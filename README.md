MMALSharp is a C# wrapper around the MMAL library designed by Broadcom. It exposes many elements of MMAL and in addition provides an easy to use, asynchronous API to the Raspberry Pi Camera Module. The library targets .NET Standard 2.0 and is compatible with Mono 5.4/.NET Core 2.0 or greater [runtimes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).


## Installation

MMALSharp NuGet package:

```
PM> Install-Package MMALSharp
```

MMALSharp.FFmpeg NuGet package:
[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/MMALSharp.FFmpeg.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/MMALSharp.FFmpeg)

```
PM> Install-Package MMALSharp.FFmpeg
```

Pre-release builds can be found on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/gallery/mmalsharp):

## Logging configuration

For v0.6, MMALSharp now uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` to provide package agnostic logging. If you want to enable logging, you must provide the `ILoggerFactory` 
instance your client application is using. For .NET Core applications, this will typically be done during dependency injection configuration. For more information, please
see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). 

Below is an example on how to configure NLog in a .NET Core 3.0+ console app. Note: the `ILoggerFactory` instance should be set before carrying out any MMALSharp specific operations:

```csharp
var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
{
	builder                
	.ClearProviders()
	.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace)                
	.AddNLog("NLog.config");
});

MMALLog.LoggerFactory = loggerFactory;
```

Also see [here](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Getting-started-with-.NET-Core-2---Console-application) for full NLog integration instructions.


## Basic Examples

Take a JPEG image using YUV420 encoding:

```csharp
public void TakePicture()
{
    // Singleton initialized lazily. Reference once in your application.
    MMALCamera cam = MMALCamera.Instance;

    using (var imgCaptureHandler = new ImageStreamCaptureHandler("/home/pi/images/", "jpg"))        
    {            
        await cam.TakePicture(imgCaptureHandler, MMALEncoding.JPEG, MMALEncoding.I420);
    }
    
    // Cleanup disposes all unmanaged resources and unloads Broadcom library. To be called when no more processing is to be done
    // on the camera.
    cam.Cleanup();
}
```

Take a H.264 video using YUV420 encoding at 30 fps:

```csharp
public void TakeVideo()
{
    // Singleton initialized lazily. Reference once in your application.
    MMALCamera cam = MMALCamera.Instance;

    using (var vidCaptureHandler = new VideoStreamCaptureHandler("/home/pi/videos/", "avi"))        
    {    
        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(3));
                
        await cam.TakeVideo(vidCaptureHandler, cts.Token);
    }   

    // Cleanup disposes all unmanaged resources and unloads Broadcom library. To be called when no more processing is to be done
    // on the camera.
    cam.Cleanup();
}
```

## Basic Configuration

Below are common global configuration properties which you may want to edit:

```csharp
MMALCameraConfig.Resolution = new Resolution(640, 480); // Set to 640 x 480. Default is 1280 x 720.
MMALCameraConfig.Framerate = new MMAL_RATIONAL_T(20, 1); // Set to 20fps. Default is 30fps.
MMALCameraConfig.ShutterSpeed = 2000000; // Set to 2s exposure time. Default is 0 (auto).
MMALCameraConfig.ISO = 400; // Set ISO to 400. Default is 0 (auto).
```
